# Rust Athens Meetups

This repository is meant to hold information related to the meetups.

As a community around a programming language it kind of made sense to track everything on gihtub.
So, this is where events will be coordinated, scheduled etc and this is the place where material of past events will be kept.

## Event scheduling
Each event will be scheduled throught the issue tracker.

## Past events

Material related to past events will be stored in this repository and we will also added to the wiki.
